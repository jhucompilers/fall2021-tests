These are test cases for assignment 2.

The `input` directory contains the test case (i.e., the interpreter programs
being tested.)

The `data` directory contains data that will be sent as standard input to
the interpreter for test cases that require it (specifically, test cases
which call the readint intrinsic function.)

The `expected_output` directory has expected outputs for the tests that
aren't expected to terminated by a fatal error.

The `expected_error` directory has expected standard error output for tests
that are expected to generate an error message.
